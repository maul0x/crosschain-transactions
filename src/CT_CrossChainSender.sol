/**
 * @title CT_CrossChainSender
 * @notice A contract that facilitates cross-chain ERC20 token deposits 
 *         using Wormhole's TokenBridge and Relayer SDK.
 * 
 * ### High-Level Workflow:
 * 1. A user calls {sendCrossChainDeposit} on the source chain.
 * 2. The contract:
 *    - Collects the required cross-chain fee (quoted from Wormhole relayer).
 *    - Pulls tokens from the sender via {IERC20.transferFrom}.
 *    - Encodes the recipient address into a payload.
 *    - Sends both tokens and payload cross-chain using Wormhole's relayer.
 * 3. The paired contract (e.g., {CrossChainReceiver}) on the destination chain 
 *    receives the message and tokens, and finalizes delivery to the recipient.
 * 
 * ### Security Notes:
 * - Users must approve this contract to spend tokens before calling 
 *   {sendCrossChainDeposit}.
 * - The required Wormhole relayer fee must be sent with the transaction (`msg.value`).
 * - GAS_LIMIT is hardcoded to ensure enough execution gas for the destination call.
 * 
 * ### Deployment Notes:
 * - This contract must be deployed on the source chain(s) from which tokens 
 *   will be sent.
 * - The constructor requires Wormhole dependencies: relayer, token bridge, core.
